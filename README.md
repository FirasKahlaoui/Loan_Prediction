# Loan Prediction Project

## About This Project

The "loan-prediction" project is a comprehensive learning exercise covering data cleaning, visualization, interpreting results, model building, and interface development using Flask. It aims to predict loan approval status based on various features and provide insights into the data analysis process.

### Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the loan dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict loan approval.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
- **Interface Development**: Building a web interface using Flask to interactively predict loan approval based on user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model building and evaluation
- Flask for web interface development
